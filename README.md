### Hi there 👋
These days, I wanted to involve github rather than staying local so that's my profile, don't except fancy statistics for now.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Kavpuz which is attempt to write a experimental OS for arm.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Hashing Algorithms, Compiler design and OS design.
- 💬 As hobbies, I had interest on Animes, Hatsune Miku and Light Novels from Japan
- 📫 You can feel free to contact me about anything(maybe some chit-chat as well) from my email address, Discord (れいな#1395) or Matrix (@reina.39:matrix.org)
